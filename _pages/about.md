I will be joining the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://engineering.uottawa.ca/eecs) at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en) in **September 2025**, where I will establish the **Machine Intelligence and Robot Learning (MIRL)** group. I am currently recruiting motivated **Master’s and Ph.D. students** interested in **reinforcement learning (RL)** with applications in **robotics, automation, scientific discovery**, and beyond.

My research centers on **embodied AI**—developing intelligent agents that interact with and learn from the physical world. I am particularly interested in how agents can learn **efficiently and safely**, and **adapt to new or evolving conditions**. My work spans **safe reinforcement learning**, **observation-cost-sensitive decision-making**, and **learning from limited or imbalanced data**, with a strong focus on real-world applicability.

Currently, I am a **Staff Scientist** at the [National Research Council of Canada (NRC)](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) and an **Adjunct Professor** in the [Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html). At the NRC, my work focuses on the development of AI for complex design problems where data is **costly, limited, or high-stakes**. This includes:

- Deep learning from limited and imbalanced datasets  
- Observation- and intervention-aware reinforcement learning  
- Sim2real transfer and model-based control  

From 2016–2018, I was a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) with the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/), working with [Dr. Osmar Zaïane](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/) on learning from rare and structured data. I also held a short-term research appointment at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) with [Dr. Luís Torgo](https://www.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo/) on **class imbalance** and **rare case learning**, which remain central to my research.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en), where I was supervised by [Dr. Nathalie Japkowicz](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/nathalie-japkowicz) and [Dr. Christopher Drummond](https://www.cs.dal.ca/~cdrom/). My dissertation, *A Framework for Manifold-Based Synthetic Oversampling*, focused on developing techniques to improve learning from imbalanced data. I completed my **Master’s** at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. John Oommen](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~oommen/), with a thesis titled *Modelling and Classifying Stochastically Episodic Events*.
